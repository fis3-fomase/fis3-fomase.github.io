Here we provide some details about the project.

## History and background

Term **[macro-programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroprogramming)** was introduced in early 2000s in the context of programming paradigms for wireless sensor networks (WSN).

{{< callout note >}}In basically all the research papers, term macro-programming was always introduced informally and in limited extent.{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout note >}}By a terminological perspective, macro-programming appears to recall "macros" (the technique for symbolic substitution in programs); however, it actually refers to **"macroscopic"**.{{< /callout >}}

The notion was never addressed directly and in explicitly terms, until two surveys that emerged in 2021/2022, one of which from the FoMaSE principal investigator:

- **[Macroprogramming: Concepts, State of the Art, and Opportunities of Macroscopic Behaviour Modelling (Roberto Casadei, 2023, ACMSUR)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3579353) (see also the [longer arXiv version](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2201.03473) in 2022)**
- Macroprogramming in the internet of things: A systematic mapping study (Santana et al., 2021, SBCUP)

Conceptually, macro-programming is related to (at least) three broad areas:

* **multi-agent systems (MAS)**, including normative MAS, organisational paradigms, holonic MAS, etc.
* **distributed systems**, including service computing (e.g., choreographies), WSNs, etc.
* **collective adaptive systems (CAS)**, including **self-organisation/swarm programming**, [aggregate computing]() (cf. spatial computing, amorphous computing)

{{< callout note >}}The **micro-macro link** is a long-standing issue in MAS research, as well as in "complexity science" threads (e.g., study of emergent phenomena).{{< /callout >}}


However, the idea of *macro-programming* is more specific than what you normally find in those areas.
In some way, the idea is of programming the overall collective behaviour of a computational system (possibly distributed) using denotations of macroscopic entities or outcomes.
So, conceptually, the entire distributed computational ensemble is the "single machine" that you program against.

{{< callout note >}}Macro-programming appears to entail a **macro-to-micro** directionality: the program talks about macroscopic aspects, and micro-level behaviour is induced in turn.{{< /callout >}}

What are the benefits of macro-programming? Intuitively, you get a simplified, coarse-grained description of a collective behaviour. Of course, when talking about Turing-equivalent programming paradigms, it is a matter of practical expressiveness and the benefits related to program understanding, maintainability, and so on.
