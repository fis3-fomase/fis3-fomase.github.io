abstract: Massive deployments of devices across all kinds of environments pose the
  need for engineering their collaborative, macro-level behaviour. To address this
  challenge, so-called macro-programming approaches have emerged. A prominent nature-inspired
  example of macro-programming is aggregate computing. In aggregate computing, macroscopic
  and self-organising behaviour is declared as a functional manipulation of computational
  fields. Fields are macro-level abstractions mapping devices to values over time,
  whose computation details, typically based on an execution model of asynchronous
  sense–compute–interact rounds, are abstracted. In more than ten years of research,
  multiple software engineering concerns in aggregate computing systems have been
  investigated, addressing aspects at the level of the language, execution dynamics,
  middleware, and deployment. Arguably, the enabling factor for many of such investigations
  and results is precisely the declarative nature of the aggregate computing paradigm.
  In this experience report, we analyse aggregate computing through the lenses of
  declarative programming, and draw significant insights and perspectives related
  to the engineering of complex adaptive systems.
