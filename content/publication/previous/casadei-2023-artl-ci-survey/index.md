abstract: Collectiveness is an important property of many systems—both natural and
  artificial. By exploiting a large number of individuals, it is often possible to
  produce effects that go far beyond the capabilities of the smartest individuals
  or even to produce intelligent collective behavior out of not-so-intelligent individuals.
  Indeed, collective intelligence, namely, the capability of a group to act collectively
  in a seemingly intelligent way, is increasingly often a design goal of engineered
  computational systems—motivated by recent technoscientific trends like the Internet
  of Things, swarm robotics, and crowd computing, to name only a few. For several
  years, the collective intelligence observed in natural and artificial systems has
  served as a source of inspiration for engineering ideas, models, and mechanisms.
  Today, artificial and computational collective intelligence are recognized research
  topics, spanning various techniques, kinds of target systems, and application domains.
  However, there is still a lot of fragmentation in the research panorama of the topic
  within computer science, and the verticality of most communities and contributions
  makes it difficult to extract the core underlying ideas and frames of reference.
  The challenge is to identify, place in a common structure, and ultimately connect
  the different areas and methods addressing intelligent collectives. To address this
  gap, this article considers a set of broad scoping questions providing a map of
  collective intelligence research, mostly by the point of view of computer scientists
  and engineers. Accordingly, it covers preliminary notions, fundamental concepts,
  and the main research perspectives, identifying opportunities and challenges for
  researchers on artificial and computational collective intelligence engineering.
