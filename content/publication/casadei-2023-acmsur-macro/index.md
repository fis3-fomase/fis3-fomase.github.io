abstract: Macroprogramming refers to the theory and practice of expressing the macro(scopic)
  behaviour of a collective system using a single program. Macroprogramming approaches
  are motivated by the need of effectively capturing global/system-level aspects and
  the collective behaviour of multiple computational components, while abstracting
  over low-level details. Previously, this programming style had been primarily adopted
  to describe the data-processing logic in sensor networks; recently, research forums
  on spatial computing, collective systems, and the Internet of Things have provided
  renewed interest in macro approaches. However, related contributions are still fragmented
  and lack conceptual consistency. Therefore, to foster principled research, an integrated
  view of the field is provided, together with opportunities and challenges.
