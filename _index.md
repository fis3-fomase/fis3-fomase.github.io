Here we provide some details about the project.

## History and background

Term [macro-programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroprogramming) was introduced in early 2000s in the context of programming paradigms for wireless sensor networks (WSN).

Conceptually, it is related to (at least) three broad areas:

* **multi-agent systems (MAS)**, including normative MAS, organisational paradigms, holonic MAS, etc.
* **distributed systems**, including service computing (e.g., choreographies), WSNs, etc.
* **collective adaptive systems (CAS)**, including **self-organisation/swarm programming**, [aggregate computing]() (cf. spatial computing, amorphous computing)
