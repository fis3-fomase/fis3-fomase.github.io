abstract = {Massive deployments of devices across all kinds of environments pose the need for engineering their collaborative, macro-level behaviour. To address this challenge, so-called macro-programming approaches have emerged. A prominent nature-inspired example of macro-programming is aggregate computing. In aggregate computing, macroscopic and self-organising behaviour is declared as a functional manipulation of computational fields. Fields are macro-level abstractions mapping devices to values over time, whose computation details, typically based on an execution model of asynchronous sense–compute–interact rounds, are abstracted. In more than ten years of research, multiple software engineering concerns in aggregate computing systems have been investigated, addressing aspects at the level of the language, execution dynamics, middleware, and deployment. Arguably, the enabling factor for many of such investigations and results is precisely the declarative nature of the aggregate computing paradigm. In this experience report, we analyse aggregate computing through the lenses of declarative programming, and draw significant insights and perspectives related to the engineering of complex adaptive systems.},

    abstract = "{Collectiveness is an important property of many systems—both natural and artificial. By exploiting a large number of individuals, it is often possible to produce effects that go far beyond the capabilities of the smartest individuals or even to produce intelligent collective behavior out of not-so-intelligent individuals. Indeed, collective intelligence, namely, the capability of a group to act collectively in a seemingly intelligent way, is increasingly often a design goal of engineered computational systems—motivated by recent technoscientific trends like the Internet of Things, swarm robotics, and crowd computing, to name only a few. For several years, the collective intelligence observed in natural and artificial systems has served as a source of inspiration for engineering ideas, models, and mechanisms. Today, artificial and computational collective intelligence are recognized research topics, spanning various techniques, kinds of target systems, and application domains. However, there is still a lot of fragmentation in the research panorama of the topic within computer science, and the verticality of most communities and contributions makes it difficult to extract the core underlying ideas and frames of reference. The challenge is to identify, place in a common structure, and ultimately connect the different areas and methods addressing intelligent collectives. To address this gap, this article considers a set of broad scoping questions providing a map of collective intelligence research, mostly by the point of view of computer scientists and engineers. Accordingly, it covers preliminary notions, fundamental concepts, and the main research perspectives, identifying opportunities and challenges for researchers on artificial and computational collective intelligence engineering.}",

abstract = {Macroprogramming refers to the theory and practice of expressing the macro(scopic) behaviour of a collective system using a single program. Macroprogramming approaches are motivated by the need of effectively capturing global/system-level aspects and the collective behaviour of multiple computational components, while abstracting over low-level details. Previously, this programming style had been primarily adopted to describe the data-processing logic in sensor networks; recently, research forums on spatial computing, collective systems, and the Internet of Things have provided renewed interest in macro approaches. However, related contributions are still fragmented and lack conceptual consistency. Therefore, to foster principled research, an integrated view of the field is provided, together with opportunities and challenges.},
